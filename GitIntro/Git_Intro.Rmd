# Basic Concepts
## Version Control Systems
* Local Version Control Systems: Use a local database to track all the changes to files under version control. e.g. RCS

* Centralized Version Control Systems: Have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that centrol place. e.g. subversion

* Distributed Version Control Systems: Each client fully mirrors the repository. e.g. git

* CVCS vs DVCS: DVCS allows working locally, and commit when internet access is available.

## Intro to Git
* Snapshots, Not Differences
* Nearly Every Operation Is Local
* Git Has Integrity: Uses checksum
* Git Generally Only Adds Data
* The Three States
    + Commited
    + Modified
    + Staged
    
# Git commands
* .gitignore file
* git diff [--staged]
* git commit -a(automatically stage every file that is already tracked)
* git log and all their optioins
* git remote [-v]
* git fetch vs git pull: git fetch will only download the files, but git pull will also merge the differences
* git tag
