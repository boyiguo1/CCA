# Multivariate Random Forests

## Development of recursive partitioning methods

## Regression Tree Method
### Four components
1. A set of binary questions phrased  in terms of the predictors that served to partition the predictor space
2. A node impurity measure, e.g. variance reduction
3. A split function, $\theta(s,t)$, that can be evaluated for each allowable split. The best split, optimaizes $\theta$
