### Terms Related to Data Clearning

* **Data cleaning**: Process of detecting, diagnosing, and editing faulty data
* **Data editing**: Chaning the value of data shown to be incorrect
* **Data flow**: Passage of recorded information through successive information carriers
* **Inlier**: Data value falling within the expected range
* **Outlier**: Data value falling outside the expected range
* **Robust estimation**: Estimation of statistical parameters, using methods that are less sensitive to the effect of outliers than more conventional methods

### qulaity assurance process
* error prevention
* data monitoring
* data clearning
* documentation

### Data Cleaning
Three stage process: repeated cycles of screening, diagnosing, and editing of suspected data abnormalities.
data cleaning must be based on knowledge of technical errors and expectd ranges of normal values
Priority of errors

### Oddities
Oddities in screening phase:
* Lack or excess of data
* Outliers(including inconsistencies)
* Strange patterns in distributions
* unexpected analysis results

Special problem: erroneous inliers(data points generated by error but falling within the expected range)
