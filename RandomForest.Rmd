## Development

Tree-structured methods showed their deficiency, poor predictive performance, comparing to the emerging methods, such as support vector machines. In the following years, Breiman developed a serious of methods to remedy the shortcomes, such as ensemble trees, bagging. Where bagging reduces prediction error since tree gives unstable predictors. Random forest works to reuce correlation between trees, by adding some randomness(mtry part). The accuracy improves from RF.
